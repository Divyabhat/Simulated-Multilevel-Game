# Simulated-Multilevel-Game
Hobby Game Project
This is my summer hobby project in which I designed and developed a single-player multi-level game with clear objectives to complete each game level. The game was completely coded in Java in an object-oriented way with dedicated keyboard keys to control the movements of the player in a
two-dimensional array.
